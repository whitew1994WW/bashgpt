# Bash GPT

This is a simple bash script that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to write bash commands to answer your questions. For instance see the below screenshots of the tool in action:

![Example 1](./examples/example1.png)
![Example 2](./examples/example2.png)
![Example 3](./examples/example3.png)

You can also pass the --explain parameter to give a reason why that command was chosen and what the output means:
